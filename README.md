# pyai

pyai is a simple module that provides a simple way to run and save content produced by openai. This module is based off the tutorial notebook in the [OpenAI repo here](https://github.com/JoetheManHowie/OpenAI). For a detailed walk through of the classes used in this module consult those notebook tutorials.


## Overview:

We have three main use cases for the (openai python api)[https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction]: text Completion, Image generation, and Code creation. See [notebook tutorials for details](https://github.com/JoetheManHowie/OpenAI).

Here we have three Classes that allow for easy use of the create methods for any of the three use cases.

1. TextCompletion
2. ImageGeneration
3. CodeCreation

Each with similar api's, which allow you to: run prompts through the models, save the output, and display the generated result.
